	abstract = {Cooperation helps states realize mutual gains, but mistrust and disagreements over institutional design inhibit cooperation. This article develops a network explanation for how states achieve cooperation in the face of persistent coordination and collaboration problems. The analysis focuses on bilateral cooperation agreements, a vast body of treaties spanning multiple issue areas. Bilateral agreements constitute an evolving network of cooperative ties. This network defines the strategic environment in which states bargain over new agreements, endogenously influencing subsequent bilateral endeavors by revealing strategically valuable information about states’ trustworthiness and preferences over institutional design, while also generating externalities that incentivize bilateral partnerships. Inferential network analysis shows that states are more likely to create bilateral agreements if they (1) share agreements with common third parties, (2) accede to more agreements in general, and/or (3) share important exogenous characteristics with current bilateral partners. These network dynamics drive bilateral cooperation in everything from commodities to cultural exchange to fisheries.},

The need to protect {TK} and to secure fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from its use is accepted in major forums of international intellectual property law-making. Considerable differences exist, however, on the mode and scope of protection, and the extent to which the issue of {TK} protection can be addressed in respective institutions entrusted with the task: the {CBD}, {WIPO}, {WTO}, and {FAO.} In this article, general trends and specific problems that underlie demands for the protection of {TK} are analysed in light of contemporaneous trends of global economic integration in the age of global knowledge economy. After consideration of challenges and threats to {TK} that need to be addressed through a protection system, initiatives for the protection of {TK} in national and international frameworks are analytically explored, and various proposals and approaches for protection are critically examined.},

Advocates of {WikiLeaks} have overstated the scale and significance of the leaks. They also overlook many ways in which the simple logic of radical transparency – leak, publish, and wait for the inevitable outrage – can be defeated in practice. {WikiLeaks} only created the illusion of a new era in transparency. In fact the 2010 leaks revealed the obstacles to achievement of increased transparency, even in the digital age.
Points for practitioners Some commentators have regarded the {WikiLeaks} disclosures of 2010 as evidence of a broader breakdown in the conventional mechanisms for controlling government-held information. This new world has been described as one of ‘radical transparency’. But claims about the breakdown of old-style secrecy are overwrought. This article says that the significance of the {WikiLeaks} disclosures has been exaggerated, and provides reasons why it will be harder to achieve radical transparency, especially in the security sector of government.},

	abstract = {The past decade has seen a renaissance in the development of political event data sets. This has been due to at least three sets of factors. First, there have been technological changes that have reduced the cost of producing event data, including the availability of information on the Web, the development of specialized systems for automated coding, and the development of machine-assisted systems that reduce the cost of human coding. Second, event data have become much more elaborate than the original state-centric data sets such as {WEIS} and {COPDAB}, with a far greater emphasis on substate and nonstate actors, and in some data sets, the incorporation of geospatial information. Finally, there have been major institutional investments, such as support for a number of Uppsala and {PRIO} data sets, the {DARPA} {ICEWS} Asian and global data sets, and various political violence data sets from the {US} government. This article will first review the major new contributions, with a focus on those represented in this special issue, discuss some of the open problems in the existing data and finally discuss prospects for future development, including the enhanced use of open-source natural language processing tools, standardizing the coding taxonomies, and prospects for near-real-time coding systems.},

Doing so in a spatial framework is possible because each of the 77,000 events has geographic coordinates and dates. Using cartographic and geostatistical tools, the authors map the changing distribution of the events and compare them to the well-known violent-events {ACLED} database (see {O'Loughlin} et al., 2010 in this issue). They conclude that {ACLED} comprises a representative set of the more comprehensive data in the released files. The released war logs show that the Afghan insurgency spread rapidly in 2008-2009, that the insurgency is moving out of its traditional Pashtun heartlands, and remains mostly rural in location. Hotspot and cluster analysis identifies the key locations of the current war, which indicate that it is relocating to new provinces in Afghanistan while intensifying in the eastern border regions and in the south.},

	url = {http://works.bepress.com/mark_fenster/10},
	abstract = {Constitutional, criminal, and administrative laws regulating government transparency, and the theories that support them, rest on the assumption that the disclosure of information has transformative effects: disclosure can inform, enlighten, and energize the public, or it can create great harm or stymie government operations. To resolve disputes over difficult cases, transparency laws and theories typically balance disclosure’s beneficial effects against its harmful ones. {WikiLeaks} and its vigilante approach to massive document leaks challenge the underlying assumption about disclosure’s effects in two ways. First, {WikiLeaks’s} ability to receive and distribute leaked information cheaply, quickly, and seemingly unstoppably enables it to bypass the legal framework that would otherwise allow courts and officials to consider and balance disclosures’ effects. For this reason, {WikiLeaks} threatens to make transparency’s balance irrelevant. Second, its recent massive disclosures of {U.S.} military and diplomatic documents allow us to reconsider and test the assumption that disclosure produces effects that can serve as the basis for judicial and administrative prediction, calculation, and balancing. For this reason, {WikiLeaks} threatens transparency’s balance by disproving its assumption that disclosure necessarily has predictable, identifiable consequences that can be estimated ex ante or even ex post. This article studies {WikiLeaks} in order to question and evaluate prevailing laws and theories of transparency that build on the assumption that disclosure’s effects are predictable, calculable, and capable of serving as the basis for adjudicating difficult cases. Tracing {WikiLeaks’s} development, operations, theories, and effects, it demonstrates the incoherence and conceptual poverty of an effects model for evaluating and understanding transparency.},

The characteristics that make this type of attack new are that it targets an entire site, rather than aiming for removal or exclusion of specific offending materials; operates through denial of business and financial systems, in addition to targeting technical systems; and systematically harnesses extralegal pressure to achieve results beyond what law would provide or even permit.},

Using ideas from statistics, signal processing, and ecology, we provide a predictive framework able to assimilate data and give confidence estimates on the predictions. We demonstrate our methods on the {WikiLeaks} Afghan War Diary.

	abstract = {The {WikiLeaks} Afghanistan war logs contain nearly 77,00077,000 reports of incidents in the {US-led} Afghanistan war, covering the period from January 2004 to December 2009. The recent growth of data on complex social systems and the potential to derive stories from them has shifted the focus of journalistic and scientific attention increasingly toward data-driven journalism and computational social science. In this paper we advocate the usage of modern statistical methods for problems of data journalism and beyond, which may help journalistic and scientific work and lead to additional insight. Using the {WikiLeaks} Afghanistan war logs for illustration, we present an approach that builds intelligible statistical models for interpretable segments in the data, in this case to explore the fatality rates associated with different circumstances in the Afghanistan war. Our approach combines preprocessing by Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({LDA)} with model trees. {LDA} is used to process the natural language information contained in each report summary by estimating latent topics and assigning each report to one of them. Together with other variables these topic assignments serve as splitting variables for finding segments in the data to which local statistical models for the reported number of fatalities are fitted. Segmentation and fitting is carried out with recursive partitioning of negative binomial distributions. We identify segments with different fatality rates that correspond to a small number of topics and other variables as well as their interactions. Furthermore, we carve out the similarities between segments and connect them to stories that have been covered in the media. This gives an unprecedented description of the war in Afghanistan and serves as an example of how data journalism, computational social science and other areas with interest in database data can benefit from modern statistical techniques.},

The chapter begins by giving an overview of the conflict in Afghanistan which began in 2001 and the {WikiLeaks} release. An exploratory study of the data set is given which includes consistency checks, a non-parametric analysis and an evaluation of fixed effects (e.g. population density) on the conflict intensity. Results from the non-parametric analysis are used to elicit a spatio-temporal model which is then reduced to a state-space model amenable to the algorithms of Chap. 2. The chapter proceeds to discuss the results and show how important information, such as statistical descriptions of escalation and volatility, may be extracted from the analysis. The chapter concludes by assessing prediction accuracy and showing that uncertainty has been reliably quantified using this approach.},

The logic is that gainfully employed young men are less likely to participate in political violence, implying a positive correlation between unemployment and violence in locations with active insurgencies. The authors test that prediction in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Philippines, using survey data on unemployment and two newly available measures of insurgency: (1) attacks against government and allied forces and (2) violence that kill civilians. Contrary to the opportunity-cost theory, the data emphatically reject a positive correlation between unemployment and attacks against government and allied forces (p {\textless} .05 percent). There is no significant relationship between unemployment and the rate of insurgent attacks that kill civilians. The authors identify several potential explanations, introducing the notion of insurgent precision to adjudicate between the possibilities that predation on one hand, and security measures and information costs on the other, account for the negative correlation between unemployment and violence in these three conflicts.},

In Experiment 2, people judged information presented in documents ostensibly produced by the Department of State and the National Security Council as being of relatively higher quality when those documents were secret rather than public. Finally, in Experiment 3, people judged a National Security Council document as being of higher quality when presented as a secret document rather than a public document and evaluated others' decisions more favorably when those decisions were based on secret information. Discussion centers on the mediators, moderators, and broader implications of this secrecy heuristic in foreign policy contexts.},

Here, we exploit the sparsity structure of a fully-discretised log-Gaussian Cox process model by using expectation constrained approximate inference. The resulting family of expectation propagation algorithms scale well with the state dimension and the length of the temporal horizon with moderate loss in distributional accuracy. They hence provide a flexible and faster alternative to both the filtering-smoothing type algorithms and the approaches which implement the Laplace method or expectation propagation on (block) sparse latent Gaussian models. We demonstrate the use of the proposed method in the reconstruction of conflict intensity levels in Afghanistan from a {WikiLeaks} data set.},

We show how information-theoretic quantities allow for rigorous empirical study of the decision-making capacities of rational agents, and the time-asymmetric flows of information in distributed systems.

However, so far, both schools alike have drawn on anecdotal evidence only; yet, such evidence is prone to a high margin of error and does not allow a comparison of different actors. This article addresses these shortfalls by providing hard data, drawn from the Wikileaks {“Iraq} War logs” data set, on the conduct of {PSCs} in Iraq and comparing their performance to that of regular troops, that is, the {US} and Iraqi armed forces. In general, if {PSCs} are co-deployed alongside regular troops and oversight is institutionalized, their performance supersedes that of poorly trained military personnel, such as the Iraqi military, and in many cases even that of the highly capable {US} military.},

With the insights provided by the 2010 Wikileaks cables, this analysis explores how the {“Ethiopia} imperative” affected three inter-related American policy decisions in the Horn of Africa in the early twenty-first century: the decision to support Ethiopia despite its refusal to abide by a legally binding decision that favoured Eritrea following the 1998–2000 {Eritrea–Ethiopia} border war; to give Ethiopia what amounted to a “blank cheque” to invade Somalia in December 2006 and overthrow the Council of Islamic Courts ({CIC);} and to confront and isolate Eritrea diplomatically for waging proxy war against Ethiopia in Somalia.},

We first outline some problems with existing data set quality, including issues of validity, coverage, and accuracy, and we discuss some ways of identifying problems as well as some consequences of data quality problems. The core of the paper addresses the second question by analyzing the incentives and capabilities facing four key actors in a data supply chain: respondents, data collection agencies (including state bureaucracies and private organizations), international organizations, and finally, academic scholars. We conclude by making some suggestions for improving the use and construction of data sets.},

	abstract = {This article focuses on the academic reinscription of the {WikiLeaks} affair, focusing on the different receptions received within different literatures and fields. The {WikiLeaks} affair – with or without its hypothesised connections to the Anonymous collective and the Arab Spring – has had massive ruptural effects on aspects of the global political system. A small, movement-based website has inflicted a tremendous informational defeat on the world's last superpower, revealing the possible emergence of a global networked counter-power able to mount effective resistance against the world-system, possibly even the emergence of the state-network conflict as the new great-power bipolarity after the Cold War. Therefore, in many respects, and notwithstanding {WikiLeaks'} relatively closed political structures, the {WikiLeaks} affair expresses the power of networked, decentred social movements to disrupt hierarchical arrangements of state and capitalist power. {WikiLeaks} has struck a tremendous blow for the power of transnational activist networks, against the power of states. How this blow – and the corresponding redistribution of global power – is perceived, will depend fundamentally on how the commentator feels about the current distribution of global power in favour of states. Perspectives can thus be divided, not only by discipline, but also by the author's position on the state-network dichotomy. Furthermore, different academic disciplines can be mapped in terms of their relative closeness to the statist or network side of the controversy.},

This Presidential Address surveys recent developments in commercialized and globalized information technologies that have and will continue to impact political and social relationships around the world. These new technologies affect power relationships among states, as well between states and civil society. They also present possibilities for new forms of global accountability and participation in governance. Finally, a range of technologies offer new and powerful ways to collect data for our research that allow us to ask new questions. President Simmons concludes as a result that exploratory empirical research is more enticing than ever before, but cautions that we should never think we can outsource the hard job of thinking to the very technologies that make innovative research possible in the first place.},

	abstract = {{WikiLeaks-an} online whistle-blowing organization based in Sweden-released documents from {U.S.} foreign diplomats, termed "the diplomatic cables," on November 28, 2010. Upon their release, politicians from both sides of the {U.S.} political spectrum condemned the organization. This analysis demonstrates that the censure was not a result of unmanageable harm to {U.S.} foreign relations but because {WikiLeaks} violated the United States state secret privilege. Through an inductive approach, a realpolitik perspective is adopted to make sense of the aftermath of the release. Realpolitik is governance based on national interests which drives the decisions of the United State government. State secrets, while certainly having legitimate uses, are used to cover up state crimes and misdeeds. They are kept because the government seeks to control its image and any information that can harm it. Politicians and government leaders respond in a manner meant to neutralize threats to the state's image and control of information. This analysis demonstrates how realpolitik is at work through the responding political rhetoric to {WikiLeaks} release of the diplomatic cables through an examination of the use of arbitrary rhetoric-vague and open statements made by officials that leave room for interpretation favorable to the state-and the labeling of {WikiLeaks} as a criminal organization.

	abstract = {In recent years, {WikiLeaks} and Anonymous have made headlines distributing confidential information, defacing websites, and generating protest around political issues. Although many have dismissed these actors as terrorists, criminals, and troublemakers, we argue that such actors are emblematic of a new kind of political actor: extraordinary bandits (e-bandits) that engage in the politics of no one via anonymizing Internet technologies. Building on Hobsbawm's idea of the social bandit, we show how these actors fundamentally change the terms of global activism. First, as political actors, e-bandits are akin to Robin Hood, resisting the powers that be who threaten the desire to keep the Internet free, not through lobbying legislators, but by “taking” what has been deemed off limits. Second, e-banditry forces us to think about how technology changes “ordinary” transnational activism. Iconic images of street protests and massive marches often underlie the way we as scholars think about social movements and citizen action; they are ordinary ways we expect non-state actors to behave when they demand political change. E-bandits force us to understand political protest as virtual missives and actions, activity that leaves no physical traces but that has real-world consequences, as when home phone numbers and addresses of public officials are released. Finally, e-banditry is relatively open in terms of who participates, which contributes to the growing sense that activism has outgrown organizations as the way by which individuals connect. We illustrate our theory with the actions of two e-bandits, Anonymous and {WikiLeaks.}},

	url = {http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/why-i-will-not-analyze-the-new-wikileaks-data},
	abstract = {By now you surely have read about the latest massive disclosure of 
classified documents from {WikiLeaks.} Unlike the previous two disclosures, 
which were thousands of Significant Activities reports ({SIGACT)} from the 
Afghanistan and Iraq wars respectively, the latest leak are hundreds of 
thousands of cables communicated between the {U.S.} State Department and its 
many diplomats deployed around the world. As many of you know, after the 
first {WikiLeaks} disclosure on the Afghanistan War I—along with 
others—generated several analyses and visualizations based on this data.

I am a strong supporter of government transparency, and open data and 
analysis more generally. I viewed the first large {WikiLeaks} disclosure as 
an unprecedented opportunity to show the power of such openness. This, 
however, was not without reservation. Having worked inside the {U.S.} 
intelligence community, I was cognizant of the potential damage these data 
could do; first with respect to the {U.S.} government, but more importantly 
to those individuals working inside Afghanistan. Mindful of this, we 
focused on aggregate-level analyses of the data, and did not investigate 
individual reports or expose the names they contained.

I still believe that significant and meaningful discoveries are yet to be 
made from the Afghanistan disclosure about conflict, its effect on 
civilians, and the spatial-temporal nature of violence. I do not, however, 
believe that such discovery was ever the intent of the {WikiLeaks} 
organization. To the contrary, {WikiLeaks's} continued and reckless pursuit 
of classified document disclosures seems to have much more to do with the 
proclivities of the organization's founder, and very little to do with 
building knowledge or improving democratic discourse.

The latest leak typifies the identity and culture of {WikiLeaks} and by 
continuing to analyze new disclosures I am tacitly supporting this, which 
is something I will not do. {WikiLeaks'} motivation is that of a court 
jester, to mock and ridicule the contradictions of a state. However, they 
present themselves as a sage with the wisdom to adjudicate the public 
relevance of all information, which is the greatest contradiction of all.

To be clear, this is an entirely personal decision, and is not meant to 
discourage others from endeavoring to glean insight from this new data. The 
substantive value of the day-to-day machinations of diplomats, however, is 
dubious at best—even at aggregate.

Openness of information can lead to great things, not the least of which is 
the democratization of knowledge in ways never before possible. Shoving 
private messages into the public sphere without any context or care for the 
consequences can lead to misunderstanding, fear, and aggression. 
Unfortunately, {WikiLeaks} appears to be in the business of promoting the 
latter.},

	abstract = {Debates about biotechnology continue to be polarized despite its potential to improve the living standards of the poor in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the backdrop of this polarized scenario, this paper asked, is there a place for brokers in bringing about a productive debate that is pro-development? The paper argued that if potential intermediaries are analyzed from the perspective of understanding their role and stakeholding in the regulatory change process, this may help breakout the current polarized anti- and pro-biotechnology debates and thereby focus on how to enable productive biotechnology development. Informed by insights from innovation brokering, the functions of brokers in biotechnology regulation are analyzed through the lens of organizations involved in agricultural biotechnology debates in Kenya. The analysis found that policy brokering function attracts varying opportunities and challenges appropriate for informing relevant policy. The paper drew lessons from Kenya's experience to inform a productive policy brokering model for biotechnology regulation.},

Here, the policy outcome was what we call a “hybrid” and “conciliatory” regulatory model, which formally acknowledges the importance of both technical/scientific and social/political considerations in the evaluation of {GMO} biosafety and engages most of the stakeholders in the regulatory process. The new policy regime also establishes a middle ground between the conflicting demands of promoting agricultural development and protecting the country's biodiversity.},

This is an account of the 2009 Copenhagen summit from the perspective of a government delegate.

It outlines key policy issues under negotiation, the positions and policy preferences of key countries and coalitions, the outcomes of Copenhagen, and achievements and failures in climate negotiations to date. The Copenhagen Accord is a weak agreement designed to mask the political failure of the international community to create a global climate treaty. However, climate policy around the world is making considerable progress. While the {UN} negotiations process is deadlocked, multilevel climate governance is thriving.},

	isbn = {9781442614543},
	shorttitle = {Copyfight},
	abstract = {Widespread file sharing has led content industries – publishers and distributors of books, music, films, and software – to view their customers as growing threats to their survival. Content providers and their allies, especially the {U.S.} government, have pushed for stronger global copyright policies through international treaties and domestic copyright reforms. Internet companies, individuals, and public-interest groups have pushed back, with massive street protests in Europe and online “internet blackouts” that derailed the 2012 {U.S.} Stop Online Piracy Act ({SOPA).} But can citizens or smaller countries really stand in the way of the {U.S.} copyright {juggernaut?To} answer this question, Copyfight examines the 1996 World Intellectual Property Organization internet treaties that began the current digital copyright regime. Blayne Haggart follows the {WIPO} treaties from negotiation to implementation from the perspective of three countries: the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Using extensive interviews with policymakers and experts in these three countries, Haggart argues that not all the power is in the hands of the {U.S.} government. Small countries can still set their own course on copyright legislation, while growing public interest in copyright issues means that even the United States might move away from ever-increasing copyright protection.},

	shorttitle = {Negotiating {NAFTA}},
	abstract = {International negotiations have become an important feature of the world trading system, but  very few scholars have attempted to analyse this process. Using case studies in four areas - culture, textiles and apparel, autos, and pharmaceuticals - negotiated in the North American Free Trade Agreement ({NAFTA)}, Maryse Robert uses a theoretical framework to help explain the outcome of such negotiations in terms of structure and process that. The structure of negotiations relates to states' objectives, outcomes, resources (in industry and in government), and issue-specific power. Process involves state's behaviour as expressed by its tactics during negotiation. Among the questions the author raises are: How are winning and losing defined in a given issue area? What are a state's resources as it enters a trade negotiation? Are all resources equally important? Is the utility of some tactics linked to certain resources? The key message of the book is that it is the right mix of resources and tactics that determines the outcome of {negotiation.Very} few scholars have attempted to analyse trade negotiations. Using case studies in four areas - culture, textiles and apparel, autos and pharmaceuticals - Robert proposes a theoretical framework to help explain the outcome of a negotiation in the field of international trade. She argues that this outcome has two characteristics: structure and process. The former is constituted of the resources a state brings to the table in a given issue area; the latter refers to the state's behaviour as expressed by its tactics during negotiation. The key message of the book is that it is the right mix of resources and tactics that determines the outcome.},

This is seen as a valuable resource for organisations, given the potential to analyse and exploit that data to turn it into useful information. However, the cost and risk of continuing to hold that data can also make it a burden for many organisations.

There are also a number of fetters to the exploitation of Big Data. The most significant is data privacy, which cuts across the whole of the Big Data lifecycle: collection, combination, analysis and use. This article considers the current framework for the regulation of Big Data, the Article 29 Working Party's opinion on Big Data and the proposed new General Data Protection Regulation. In particular, the article considers if current and proposed regulation strikes the right balance between the risks and benefits of Big Data.},

Our empirical results, consistent with [1], confirm that size of the training set and the classification rate are indeed correlated. Even though these algorithms perform reasonably well with small datasets, as the number of cases increases, both {SMV} and Decision Trees show a substantial improvement in performance, suggesting a more consistent learning process. Unlike the majority of evaluations, ours were carried out specifically in a medical domain where the limited amount of data is a common occurrence [13][14].

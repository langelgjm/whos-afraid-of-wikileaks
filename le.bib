	abstract = {This article reconsiders the history of copyright’s pivotal fair use doctrine. The history of fair use does not in fact begin with early American cases such as Folsom v. Marsh in 1841, as most accounts assume—the complete history of the fair use doctrine begins with over a century of copyright litigation in the English courts. Reviewing this ‘pre-history’ of the American fair use doctrine leads to two significant conclusions. The first is that copyright and fair use evolved together. Virtually from its inception, statutory copyright went well beyond merely mechanical acts of reproduction and was defined by the concept of fair abridgment. The second insight gained by extending our historical view is that there is in fact substantial continuity between fair abridgment in the pre-modern era and fair use in the United States today. These findings have substantial implications for copyright law today, the principal one being that fair use is central to the formulation of copyright, and not a mere exception.},

	title = {Israeli Fair Use from an American Perspective},
	url = {http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1327906},
	abstract = {This is a chapter (in Hebrew) in an anthology on Israel's recent comprehensive copyright statute revision, the Copyright Law-2007. The chapter focuses on Section 19 of the new law, which closely tracks Section 107, the fair use provision, of the {U.S.} Copyright Act. In codifying {U.S.} fair use doctrine, Israel's legislature has replaced the narrower "fair dealing" doctrine found in Israel's prior copyright statute, the Copyright Law-1911, making Israel only the second country, after the Philippines, to adopt {U.S.} fair use law in its copyright statute. Moreover, Israel's new copyright statute essentially completes the move from fair dealing to fair use that the Israeli Supreme Court had already initiated in 1993 in its ruling in Geva v. Walt Disney Co.       Of great significance for how fair use will be applied in Israel, American case law and commentary features two distinct, mutually opposing understandings of the fair use doctrine. The "market approach" views fair use as a narrow, anomalous exception to the copyright holder's exclusive and broad proprietary rights, an exception available only in instances where voluntary licensing is prevented by insurmountable market failure. In contrast, the "expressive diversity approach" views fair use as a central component, not an anomalous exception, to the copyright regime. It places great weight on whether the defendant's use is "transformative," in other words whether the use serves a fundamentally different purpose than that for which the plaintiff's copyrighted work was created and whether that purpose serves copyright law's overall goal of promoting the dissemination of knowledge and a diversity of expression.       In recent years, the expressive diversity approach appears to be in the ascendancy over the market approach in {U.S.} case law, as evident in cases such as Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd. and Perfect 10 v. Amazon. It remains to be seen whether this trend will continue. In any event, given the Israeli Supreme Court's analysis in Geva v. Walt Disney Co., which approvingly cited {U.S.} case law favoring transformative uses, and Interlego {A/S} v. Exin Line Bros., which held that copyright's purpose is to promote expressive diversity and that copyrights must be appropriately tailored to serve that end, Israeli courts should be considerably more receptive to the expressive diversity approach to fair use than to the market approach.},

	abstract = {Given the owner-centred nature of current copyright regimes, many commentators are calling for greater consideration of user rights and, more particularly, the development of fair dealing, a legal doctrine that allows for certain uses of copyrighted material without permission of the copyright owner. Fair dealing in Canada has been criticized as weak and overly restrictive, applying only to works used for a closed list of purposes. The Supreme Court of Canada's 2004 decision in {CCH} Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada ({CCH)}, which elevated fair dealing from a set of exceptions to a user right, has strengthened fair dealing but has also created uncertainty about its scope. To arrive at a better understanding of Canada's current fair dealing framework, the author presents a historical analysis of Canadian fair dealing and compares Canada's regime with those of the United Kingdom and the United States. Despite {CCH's} liberalizing effect, the doctrine remains somewhat restrictive, but it also has features that render it more capable than its {U.S.} and {U.K.} equivalents of attaining the balance of interests that copyright regimes seek. {U.K.} fair dealing lags behind Canada: certain criteria have emerged from the case law consonant to Canada's pre- {CCH} framework and in many ways there is now a hierarchy of factors with market considerations at the fore. The concept of {U.S.} fair use, which theoretically allows any type of use to be "fair" and merely provides factors to assist courts in their decision-making, presents a more effective option, though it too has weaknesses and cannot simply be transplanted into another jurisdiction. Canada should rather seek to build on the distinctive features of its fair dealing regime, such as its policy preoccupations that avoid championing owners' rights, and factors for determining fair dealing that are more flexible than those in {U.S.} fair use. In doing so, the author cautions against eclipsing creators (who are seldom owners) and whose treatment may have become more ambiguous after {CCH.} The author suggests several ways of improving fair dealing. These solutions are not limited to legal reforms, but also involve grassroots approaches. Copyright best practices developed by users themselves are particularly promising, having already contributed to findings of fairness in {CCH} and other cases. (English)},

	url = {http://works.bepress.com/roya_ghafele/12},
	abstract = {The counterfactual impact analysis of fair use amendments in Singapore undertaken here demonstrates that flexible fair use policy positively influences growth rates in private copying technology industries. In 2010, five years after the policy intervention, Singapore’s fair use amendments are correlated with a 3.33\% increase in value-added (as \% of {GDP)} for private copying technology industries. Prior to the amendment of fair use policies, private copying technology industries experienced - 1.97\% average annual growth. After the changes were introduced, the same industries enjoyed a 10.18\% average annual growth rate. This resulted in a total increase of € 2.27 billion in value-added for private copying technology industries in that period. The results show that, prior to fair use amendments, the private copying industries in Singapore were in recession. After fair use amendments, this group experienced a rapid increase in growth rates and continued to exhibit strong growth over the five year period. Crucially, the control group, a set of technology manufacturers/services, was not significantly affected by the fair use amendments in Singapore. The counterfactual impact of fair use policies on the control group, five years after the amendment, is shown to be correlated with a 0.01\% increase in value-added (as \% of {GDP).} Despite experiencing fluctuating growth rates, the control group exhibited steady, albeit small, recession relative to the entire economy both before and after the fair use amendments. Though the year-on-year growth rates of the control group fluctuated significantly, the period-averages were closer in magnitude than the other two groups (3.89\% pre-amendment growth and -0.22\% post-amendment growth). This suggests that the control group was not significantly affected by the fair use amendments. This is a positive finding that enables us to better isolate the impact of fair use on the two industrial groups of interest. The counterfactual impact analysis results in Singapore indicate that the growth of private copying technologies has had a negligible impact on copyright industry revenue. For 2010, fair use policy was correlated with a -0.23\% reduction in value-added (as \% of {GDP)} for copyright industries. The copyright group enjoyed an average growth rate of 14.16\% before the amendments were introduced (a total increase of over € 274 million in value-added). This slowed to 6.68\% for the period after the amendments were introduced and resulted in a total increase of over € 158 million in value-added.

	abstract = {Copyright law is often perceived as an instrument for balancing the competing interests between the copyright owners and the users of copyright works. This is because of the prime importance of fostering creativity and the wide dissemination of its fruits for human development. One of the main doctrines used by copyright law for the purpose of striking a balance between the interests of the copyright owners and those of the users is ‘fair use’. The doctrine of fair use provides the users of copyright works a valid defence for unauthorised use of those works. This paper attempts to briefly examine (from a legal practitioner’s perspective) the scope of the doctrine of fair use enshrined in Sections 11(1) and (2) of the Sri Lankan Intellectual Property Act No.36 of 2003 in comparison with the same doctrine found in the copyright laws of the United States and Great Britain.},

	abstract = {One of the main objectives of the World Trade Organization ({WTO)} is to facilitate world’s trade and production. It enforces legally binding multilateral agreements on trade in goods, services and trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. The Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights ({TRIPs)} Agreement was implemented to regulate standards of Intellectual Property ({IP)} regulations in {WTO} member countries. Being a member of the {WTO} and a signatory to the {TRIPs} Agreement, it was compulsory for Sri Lanka and five other South Asian countries (Bangladesh, Nepal, the Maldives, India and Pakistan) to formulate its {IP} regulations to comply with the {TRIPs} Agreement. According to the agreement, by 2006 India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and by 2013 Bangladesh and Nepal have to provide legal protection to plant varieties and farmers’ traditional knowledge via patents or by an effective sui generis system or by both. All of the above six countries have during the past 15 years implemented or drafted several acts to comply with the {TRIPs} Agreement. Sri Lanka has passed the Intellectual Property Rights Act No. 36 of 2003 to comply with the {TRIPs} Agreement. However, this Act does not provide protection for plant varieties and farmers’ traditional knowledge as it does not allow patenting of plants. Due to several reasons such as lack of demand from civil society, a poor legal system, lack of properly established institutional system, etc,. Sri Lanka was unable to build an effective intellectual property rights regime complying with the agreement, especially for the agricultural sector. Further, due to a delay in establishing rules and regulations to comply with the agreement, the Sri Lankan agricultural sector faces several difficulties in international trade and it has also lost a number of opportunities to use its own plant varieties for the benefit of future generations. The article suggests several techniques and methods that could be followed in implementing intellectual property rights in agriculture in order to promote investments and accelerate trade especially in Sri Lanka. And also it suggests the importance of having a regional centre to manage intellectual property rights effectively among South Asian countries.},

	abstract = {Since the start of the millennium, the Australian federal government has engaged in repeated reforms of the nation's copyright laws as part of a broader response to the national and international challenges created by the advent of the internet and the wider digital revolution. This reform process has at times been both chaotic and confusing. Substantial amendments enacted in only 2001 to bring Australian copyright law into the digital age were changed substantially in response to the {Australia–United} States Free Trade Agreement ({AUSFTA)} of 2004. Concurrent to meeting the obligations created by the {AUSFTA}, the Australian government also conducted several reviews with a view to introducing new user-based exceptions to copyright infringement in an attempt to balance Australia's increasingly copyright-owner-focused legislation. These changes were enacted as part of the Copyright Amendment Act 2006 (Cth). However, any benefit that these new exceptions created for copyright users and consumers has arguably been outweighed by the implementation of stronger technological protection measures and digital rights management protection and criminal sanctions that have been accompanied by few exceptions for legitimate use. Now, at the end of an often rushed and inadequately debated reform process, few parties are expressing satisfaction with the resulting amendments.},

Drawing on interviews with traders of pirated media material, it looks at piracy as a means of distributing films and at how the piracy market works. It examines the effects that access to quality movies has on the local film culture, media literacy in general, and the teaching of film, as well as the unprecedented rise of media piracy in the last few years as one of the most prominent issues of the 'digital' millennium. Building on research into digital culture over the last ten years, the paper finally considers piracy vis-a-vis a number of other approaches towards intellectual property, which have emerged in relation to digital 'goods' and new licence policies.},

	abstract = {Unlike Taiwan's Patent Law, which expressly permits parallel importation, and the Trademark Law, where parallel imports have been held permissible by Taiwan courts, Taiwan's Copyright Law, after amendment in 1993, basically forbids parallel imports (articles 87(4) and 87-1). This enactment essentially creates a new distribution right for copyright owners. Since then, parallel imported copyright products have been treated as unlawful copies. Distributors of those parallel imports in Taiwan are therefore subject to both civil and criminal penalties. This article starts by covering the rules that govern parallel imports in Taiwan, their impacts on Taiwan's copyright market and assesses the role Taiwan's international trade policy played in view of its Copyright Law legislation. It also analyses the adverse effects of this ban on parallel imports on Taiwan's trade with other countries. As Taiwan joined the World Trade Organization ({WTO)} in 2009, it is concluded that the ban on parallel imports may be challenged by other {WTO} members as an unlawful trade barrier. The existing ban under articles 87(4) and 87-1 of Taiwan's Copyright Law does not properly address the parallel imports issues or serve the objectives of Taiwan's Copyright Law. Fair-use application on a case-by-case basis should be a more adequate approach.},

	abstract = {One question that has long recurred in copyright reform debates in Commonwealth countries is whether to adopt an open-ended fair use exception similar to that found in the {US.} This question is often answered by reference to propositions regarding the respective merits of general and specific provisions, which in turn is understood as ultimately a choice between flexibility and certainty. However this article argues that such an approach rests on under-theorized claims about the merits of different styles of drafting. It uses standards and rules analysis to revisit some of the claims that characterise debates about copyright exceptions, noting how a range of factors bear upon the flexibility and predictability of the law. This article develops these themes and makes suggestions for future reform processes using Australian developments as a backdrop, including the Australian Law Reform Commission's review on Copyright and the Digital Economy, and a case study on Australia's bespoke hybrid exception, s. {200AB.}},
